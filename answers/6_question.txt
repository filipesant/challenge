An application has four classes: A, B, C and D. Classes B and C are subclasses of A.
In classes A, B and C there are different attributes and a method called checkBalance()
with the same signature but which performs operations that return values ​​of type double,
however, different. Class D is the main class. Within the main() method of class D,
the following instructions were typed:

 A* obj = new B();
double v = obj->checkBalance();

A* obj1 = new C();
double v1 = obj1->checkBalance();

When these lines were executed, the variable v received the value 100.00
and the variable v1 received the value 125.00. Note that both obj
and obj1 are type A objects, however, in addition to having different attributes,
when calling the checkBalance() method through these objects,
the return contained in variables v and v1 was different. This shows an example of:

[] Encapsulation

[] Method Overload

[] Multiple inheritance

[] Generalization

[X] Polymorphism
